## Detailed schedule

### Before joining

- Get a MacBook, minimum Intel Core i5 4 cores processor and 16GM memory
- Install the latest version of the macOS operating system and all the updates unless there are known compatibility issues, usually it is a good practice to wait a couple of weeks after a new major version release
- Encrypt the disk storage
- Request the NHSmail account, usually this will be done by a Delivery Manager

### Day 1 and 2

- Arrange a call with an ICT representative to set up the corporate accounts
- Buddy up new starter with last person to get development environment up and running. Make sure they know it’s totally ok to ask all kinds of questions.
- The new engineer updates development environment documentation if it’s out of date or confusing. Therefore, they are contributing straight away and the documentation is better as a result.

### Day 3 to 5

- Any technical tools or frameworks they need to know but don’t yet, hand them the right material to get them started. These can be video tutorials, books, blog posts or simply the `README.md` file of the project they are going to work on.
- Ideally, have them deploy something small to learn the process of releasing the code. This can just be a configuration setting or a really small one line change.

### Week 2

- Explain the leadership, the vision of the organsation, the philosophy of the department and the ethos of the team.

### Week 3

- Start setting some goals, for what you think they can achieve ...

### Week 4

- Have them go back to things they learned in the last month, and explain a concept from start to finish ...

### Beyond

- Touch base regularly on their goals, whether there are any roadblocks to achieving them, etc.
- This is all an organic process, intended to get them up and running and confident as quickly as possible. If something is not working, let's review it as it hast fit the needs.
