## Overview

A few sentences what business problem this project solves...

## Quick Start

### Development Requirements

- macOS operating system provisioned with the `curl -L bit.ly/make-devops-macos-setup | bash` command
- `iTerm2` command-line terminal and `Visual Studio Code` source code editor, which will be installed automatically for you in the next steps

### Local Environment Configuration

Clone the repository

    git clone [project-url]
    cd ./[project-dir]

The following is equivalent to the `curl -L bit.ly/make-devops-macos-setup | bash` command. If that step has already been done it can be omitted at this point

    make macos-setup

There are essential configuration options that **must** be set before proceeding any further. As a minimum the following command will ensure that tooling like `docker` and `git` are going to operate as expected, including local secret scanning and code formatting are enabled

    make setup

Please, ask one of your colleagues for the AWS account numbers used by the project. The next command will prompt you to provide them. This information can be sourced from a properly set up project by running `make show-configuration | grep ^AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_`

    make devops-setup-aws-accounts

Generate and trust a self-signed certificate that will be used locally to enable encryption in transit

    make trust-certificate

### Local Project Setup

    make [? python|java]-virtualenv
    make build
    make start log
    open https://ui.project.local:8443

## Contributing

Here is the list of the development practices that have to be followed by the team and the individual members:

- Only use single canonical branch **main**. Any intermediate branch significantly increases the maintenance overhead of the repository.
- Apply the git rebase workflow and never merge from main to a task branch. Follow the **squash-rebase-merge** pattern to keep the history linear and clean.
- Cryptographically sign your commits using **gpg** to ensure its content have not been tampered with.
- Format the summary message of your pull request (merge request) using the following pattern **"JIRA-XXX Summary of the change being made"** for complines and clarity as well as to enable tooling to produce release notes automatically.
- Announce your PR/MR on the development Slack channel to allow any team member to review it and to share the knowledge. A change can be merged only if all comments have been addressed and it has been **approved by at least one peer**. Make good use of paring/mobbing/swarming practices for collaborative coding.

Before starting any work, please read [Contributing.md](documentation/Contributing.md) for more detailed instructions.

## Development

- Describe how to
  - Connect to a local database
  - Interact with mock components
  - Switch each individual component to the dev mode
- Code formatting
- Code quality
- Reference the [TODO.md](documentation/TODO.md) file
- Provide guidance on how to use feature toggles and branching by abstraction

## Testing

List all the type of test suites included and provide instructions how to execute them

- Unit
- Integration
- Contract
- End-to-end
- Performance
- Security
- Smoke

How to run test suite in the pipeline

### Test data and mock services

- How the test data set is produced
- Are there any mock services in place

### Manual check

Here are the steps to perform meaningful local system check:

- Log in to the system using a well known username role

## Deployment

### Artefact Versioning

E.g. semantic versioning vs. timestamp-based

### CI/CD Pipelines

List all the pipelines and their purpose

- Development
- Test
- Cleanup
- Production (deployment)

Reference the [jenkins/README.md](build/automation/lib/jenkins/README.md) file

### Deployment From the Command-line

    make deploy PROFILE=dev

### Secrets

Where are the secrets located, i.e. AWS Secrets Manager, under the `$(PROJECT_ID)-$(PROFILE)/deployment` secret name and variable `$(DEPLOYMENT_SECRETS)` should be set accordingly.

### AWS Access

To be able to interact with a remote environment, please make sure you have set up your AWS CLI credentials and
MFA to the right AWS account using the following command

    tx-mfa

### Integration

#### Interfaces

Document all the system external interfaces

- API documentation should be generated automatically

#### Dependencies

Document all the system external dependencies and integration points

### Data

What sort of data system operates on and processes

- Data set
- Consistency and integrity
- Persistence

### Authentication and authorisation

- API-first design
- Test-first approach
- Apply the automate everything pattern
- AWS-based cloud solution deployable to the NHSD CPaaS Texas platform
- Use of the Make DevOps automation scripts (macOS and Linux)
